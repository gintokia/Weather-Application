    question: "Rate your experience with the frameworks that you chose. Did they perform to your expectations?",
    answer: "We all had a great experience working with both frameworks, ReactJS and Express.js. We primarily chose these frameworks because of their flexibility and reusability, and they did perform to our expectation. ",
  },
  {
    num: 2,
    question: "Were the frameworks of your choice difficult to install or configure?",
    answer: "Both frameworks were simple to set up as they could be easily installed using npm and did not require manual configuration, although it did take quite some time to install all the required packages, files, and folders.",
  },

    question: "Was it easy to create the page(s) with the frameworks of your choice?",
    answer: "Since React allows developers to make components once and reuse and alter them across their whole website, it was quite simple and quick to create pages with it. The same can be said about Express, as its familiar syntax made creating REST APIs fairly easy. ",
  },

    num: 4,
    question: "Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML / CSS / JavaScript / PHP?",
    answer: "Because React uses JSX which is essentially a mixture of JavaScript and HTML, and Express uses JavaScript, the learning curve was less steep for group members that had prior experience with JavaScript, but steeper for those who did not. ",
  },

    num: 5,
    question: "Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret your choice of frameworks?",
    answer: "We were satisfied with our choice of frameworks for the most part, as we had researched and thought about them ahead of time and were aware of their strengths and weaknesses. However, one member regretted using modular CSS for styling, and stated that they would have preferred to use other styling methods, such as Reactâ€™s styled components, but they were also overall very satisfied with our choice of frameworks.
